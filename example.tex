Here's a very short sample BibTeX document. Among the interesting books and
papers I have read in the course of this work is Halzen and Martin's
{\it Quarks and Leptons}\,\cite{Halzen:1984mc}, and the paper {\it Can
one probe the structure of the pomeron?} by Ellis and
Ross\,\cite{Ellis:1996cg}.

And here the sample document ends.
