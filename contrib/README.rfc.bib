The ‘rfc.bib’ file was downloaded from <http://www.tm.uka.de/~bless/rfc.bib>.


It appears that it is an automatic translation from the RFC XML index published
by the IETF into a BibTeX format, published daily by Roland on his website (See
[Bless 2009] for details). — Its copyright and licensing status is unclear to
me.
