% Intro

The word ``datagram'' derives from ``telegram'' \cite[p 141]{russell}

% Just plain blabbering from now on

``VC can be built on top of the datagram service'' \cite[p 141]{russell}

VC came from the traditional pre-existing voice telephone network, which was a usually state-wide network, with interstate and overseas links.  On the other hand, packet switching was a cool new technology in the 1970s.  Nowadays, datagram takes over traditional mainstays of VC, however, VC is still being used.  It is possible to use a mixed approach.

Examples of VC: ATM, Frame Relay, X.25
Examples of datagram: internet, GPRS


Three phases of setting up the connection on a VC:

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] set-up
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Here all the resources are reserved, and everything is set
    \item The way it works, the LCI (Logical Channel Identifier) is the name of the single connection to the next node---some see it as an advantage that instead of using the (long) address, only the (short) LCI is used.  This will save bandwidth and complexity and CPU cycles compared to having to compute the route for every datagram. \cite[p 158]{russell} (the addresses are only used/needed during the initial phase of connection set-up).  However, there are ways to work around this limitation in datagram networks.
    \item Takes time, so the up-front delay can be considerably higher than datagram
    \end{itemize}
\item[2.] data transfer
    \begin{itemize}
    \item nodes use LCI
    \item the latency is considerably negligible, because there are no delays introduced by the management of the link, unlike with datagram networks
    \end{itemize}
\item[3.] tear-down
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the resources are freed
	\item LCI is forgotten
	\item the routing tables are purged
	\item bandwidth/slots are released for use for upcoming VCs
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{History}

In telephony systems, complexity is kept within the network, which allows
``dumb'' end-systems as simple as rotary phones be connected.  Internet was on
the other hand designed to connect sophisticated hosts, and designed
deliberately to be ``as simple as possible''.  Complex functionality is
implemented by the {\em transport} and {\em application} layers.  The internet
network layer is easy to implement over disparate range of {\em link} layer
technologies, such as ``satellite, Ethernet, fiber, or radio''.  It's also easy
to implement new applications, because all that is required is implemented in
the end hosts; changes to the network are not necessary.

Data in Table

are from \cite{kurose} \cite[p298--299]{stallings} \cite{russell}.

The virtues of the shiny VC technology do not prevent errors in other processes and subsystems.  Properly engineered system will function correctly regardless of which of the two approaches is used \cite[p161]{russell}

Some applications can not take advantage of the VC guaranteed sequentiality \cite[p161]{russell}

the VC advantage of link and CPU efficiency due to using the LCI in place of the full address is not so marked when workarounds and real-life costs are taken into account: datagram network does not have to work with the full-length representation of an address, and replacing the (long) address with a (short) LCI does not necessarily prove to result in significant savings \cite[p161]{russell}

\section{Routing in Datagram Networks}

Router maintains mapping route $\rightarrow$ interface

Static routing

Automatic routing protocols, change routing table typically every few minutes. \cite{xxx}  In a VC network, the routing table effectively changes with every VC setup/teardown, i.e.\ constantly.

\section{Hybrid Approach}

It is possible to use a hybrid approach, and in fact many networks currently deployed do so.

VC intereface, datagram network---so that the advantage of having a nice and comfortable interface presented to the host is married with the flexibility and cost-efficiency of a datagram network.
